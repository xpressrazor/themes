If you have problem connecting with remote using ssh (say after distro re-install). 

1. Create and add a key using ssh (see ssh tutorial). Next upload the ssh public key to github.
2. Go to your git project directory and if commit is failing due to ssh change the url as

git remote set-url origin ssh://git@github.com/username/project.git

now you can do the push

1. Reading words from a text file

a. First way

#!/bin/bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
	wn $line -over
done 

# All you have to do is redirect file E.g ./thiscript.sh < wordlist.txt 
# Or you could add < "wordlist.txt" in last line

b. Second way

#!/bin/bash
for WORD in $(cat /etc/hosts); 
# for WORD in `cat /etc/hosts`
do
    echo "Word: $WORD"
done

c. Third way (one-liner)
cat /etc/hosts | xargs -l1 echo "$1"
cat /etc/hosts | awk '{print $0}'
